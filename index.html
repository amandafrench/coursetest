  <p>Hello Coursera. This is not my first website! I've been creating and updating them since the late 1990s.</p>
  <p>I prefer using the command line, but I've set up GitHub Desktop for this course. I'm on a Mac and am using BBEdit as my text editor (basically the same as TextWrangler).</p>
  <p>I've also taught people to write HTML and CSS, but I'm not at all good at JavaScript and am hoping to improve my skills there. I also tend to only learn what's necessary to update a particular site, so I'm looking forward to learning in a more comprehensive way. I enjoyed the history of the web and internet section: I knew some of it but not all of it. Also I've seen many GitHub Pages sites but haven't published one myself before now, so it's nice to know how to do that.</p>
